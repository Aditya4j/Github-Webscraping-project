# Github-Webscraping-project

This project is designed to scrape and collect information about various topics and their top repositories from GitHub. The goal is to automate the process of extracting topic details, such as titles, descriptions, and URLs, and then retrieving repository details for each topic, including repository names, usernames, star counts, and URLs. The collected data is then saved into CSV files named after each topic.
